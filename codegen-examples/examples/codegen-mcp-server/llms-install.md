Please read two things before trying to install this codegen MCP server:

1. [Readme](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codegen-sh/codegen-sdk/refs/heads/develop/codegen-examples/examples/codegen-mcp-server/README.md)

- This contains the instructions for setting up the mcp server

2. [Documentation Index for Agents](https://docs.codegen.com/llms.txt)

- This contains a list of urls to the documentation for topics related to creating codegen codemods

Please use a CURL command to retrieve the contents of the readme and documentation and read both before starting to install the server.

1. curl -sL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codegen-sh/codegen-sdk/refs/heads/develop/README.md" | cat

1. curl -sL "https://docs.codegen.com/llms.txt" | cat

This should give you all the context you need to successfully install and utilize the server.
