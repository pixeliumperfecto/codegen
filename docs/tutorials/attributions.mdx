# AI Impact Analysis

This tutorial shows how to use Codegen's attribution extension to analyze the impact of AI on your 
codebase. You'll learn how to identify which parts of your code were written by AI tools like 
GitHub Copilot, Devin, or other AI assistants.

Note: the code is flexible - you can track CI pipeline bots, or any other contributor you want.


## Overview

The attribution extension analyzes git history to:

1. Identify which symbols (functions, classes, etc.) were authored or modified by AI tools
2. Calculate the percentage of AI contributions in your codebase
3. Find high-impact AI-written code (code that many other parts depend on)
4. Track the evolution of AI contributions over time

## Installation

The attribution extension is included with Codegen. No additional installation is required.

## Basic Usage

### Running the Analysis

You can run the AI impact analysis using the Codegen CLI:

```bash
codegen analyze-ai-impact
```

Or from Python code:

```python
from codegen import Codebase
from codegen.extensions.attribution.cli import run

# Initialize codebase from current directory
codebase = Codebase.from_repo("your-org/your-repo", language="python")

# Run the analysis
run(codebase)
```

### Understanding the Results

The analysis will print a summary of AI contributions to your console and save detailed results to a JSON file. The summary includes:

- List of all contributors (human and AI)
- Percentage of commits made by AI
- Number of files and symbols touched by AI
- High-impact AI-written code (code with many dependents)
- Top files by AI contribution percentage

## Advanced Usage

### Accessing Attribution Information

After running the analysis, each symbol in your codebase will have attribution information attached to it:

```python
from codegen import Codebase
from codegen.extensions.attribution.main import add_attribution_to_symbols

# Initialize codebase
codebase = Codebase.from_repo("your-org/your-repo", language="python")

# Add attribution information to symbols
ai_authors = ['github-actions[bot]', 'dependabot[bot]', 'copilot[bot]']
add_attribution_to_symbols(codebase, ai_authors)

# Access attribution information on symbols
for symbol in codebase.symbols:
    if hasattr(symbol, 'is_ai_authored') and symbol.is_ai_authored:
        print(f"AI-authored symbol: {symbol.name} in {symbol.filepath}")
        print(f"Last editor: {symbol.last_editor}")
        print(f"All editors: {symbol.editor_history}")
```

### Customizing AI Author Detection

By default, the analysis looks for common AI bot names in commit authors. 
You can customize this by providing your own list of AI authors:

```python
from codegen import Codebase
from codegen.extensions.attribution.main import analyze_ai_impact

# Initialize codebase
codebase = Codebase.from_repo("your-org/your-repo", language="python")

# Define custom AI authors
ai_authors = [
    'github-actions[bot]',
    'dependabot[bot]',
    'copilot[bot]',
    'devin[bot]',
    'your-custom-ai-email@example.com'
]

# Run analysis with custom AI authors
results = analyze_ai_impact(codebase, ai_authors)
```

## Example: Contributor Analysis

Here's a complete example that analyzes contributors to your codebase and their impact:

```python
import os
from collections import Counter

from codegen import Codebase
from codegen.extensions.attribution.main import add_attribution_to_symbols
from codegen.git.repo_operator.repo_operator import RepoOperator
from codegen.git.schemas.repo_config import RepoConfig
from codegen.sdk.codebase.config import ProjectConfig
from codegen.shared.enums.programming_language import ProgrammingLanguage

def analyze_contributors(codebase):
    """Analyze contributors to the codebase and their impact."""
    print("\n🔍 Contributor Analysis:")
    
    # Define which authors are considered AI
    ai_authors = ['devin[bot]', 'codegen[bot]', 'github-actions[bot]', 'dependabot[bot]']
    
    # Add attribution information to all symbols
    print("Adding attribution information to symbols...")
    add_attribution_to_symbols(codebase, ai_authors)
    
    # Collect statistics about contributors
    contributor_stats = Counter()
    ai_contributor_stats = Counter()
    
    print("Analyzing symbol attributions...")
    for symbol in codebase.symbols:
        if hasattr(symbol, 'last_editor') and symbol.last_editor:
            contributor_stats[symbol.last_editor] += 1
            
            # Track if this is an AI contributor
            if any(ai in symbol.last_editor for ai in ai_authors):
                ai_contributor_stats[symbol.last_editor] += 1
    
    # Print top contributors overall
    print("\n👥 Top Contributors by Symbols Authored:")
    for contributor, count in contributor_stats.most_common(10):
        is_ai = any(ai in contributor for ai in ai_authors)
        ai_indicator = "🤖" if is_ai else "👤"
        print(f"  {ai_indicator} {contributor}: {count} symbols")
    
    # Print top AI contributors if any
    if ai_contributor_stats:
        print("\n🤖 Top AI Contributors:")
        for contributor, count in ai_contributor_stats.most_common(5):
            print(f"  • {contributor}: {count} symbols")

# Initialize codebase from current directory
if os.path.exists(".git"):
    repo_path = os.getcwd()
    repo_config = RepoConfig.from_repo_path(repo_path)
    repo_operator = RepoOperator(repo_config=repo_config)
    
    project = ProjectConfig.from_repo_operator(
        repo_operator=repo_operator,
        programming_language=ProgrammingLanguage.PYTHON
    )
    codebase = Codebase(projects=[project])
    
    # Run the contributor analysis
    analyze_contributors(codebase)
```

## Conclusion

The attribution extension provides valuable insights into how AI tools are being used in your 
development process. By understanding which parts of your codebase are authored by AI, you can:

- Track the adoption of AI coding assistants in your team
- Identify areas where AI is most effective
- Ensure appropriate review of AI-generated code
- Measure the impact of AI on developer productivity
