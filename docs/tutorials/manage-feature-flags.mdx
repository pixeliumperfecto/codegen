Codegen has been used in production for multi-million line codebases to automatically delete "dead" (rolled-out) feature flags. This guide will walk you through analyzing feature flag usage and safely removing rolled out flags.

<Warning>
    Every codebase does feature flags differently. This guide shows common techniques and syntax but likely requires adaptation to codebase-specific circumstances.
</Warning>

## Analyzing Feature Flag Usage

Before removing a feature flag, it's important to analyze its usage across the codebase. Codegen provides tools to help identify where and how feature flags are used.

### For Python Codebases

For Python codebases using a `FeatureFlags` class pattern like so:
```python
class FeatureFlags:
    FEATURE_1 = False
    FEATURE_2 = True
```

You can use [Class.get_attribute(...)](/api-reference/core/Class#get-attribute) and [Attribute.usages](/api-reference/core/Attribute#usages) to analyze the coverage of your flags, like so:



```python
feature_flag_usage = {}
feature_flag_class = codebase.get_class('FeatureFlag')

if feature_flag_class:
    # Initialize usage count for all attributes
    for attr in feature_flag_class.attributes:
        feature_flag_usage[attr.name] = 0
    
    # Get all usages of the FeatureFlag class
    for usage in feature_flag_class.usages:
        usage_source = usage.usage_symbol.source if hasattr(usage, 'usage_symbol') else str(usage)
        for flag_name in feature_flag_usage.keys():
            if f"FeatureFlag.{flag_name}" in usage_source:
                feature_flag_usage[flag_name] += 1

    sorted_flags = sorted(feature_flag_usage.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

    print("Feature Flag Usage Table:")
    print("-------------------------")
    print(f"{'Feature Flag':<30} | {'Usage Count':<12}")
    print("-" * 45)
    for flag, count in sorted_flags:
        print(f"{flag:<30} | {count:<12}")

    print(f"\nTotal feature flags: {len(sorted_flags)}")
else:
    print("❗ FeatureFlag enum not found in the codebase")
```

This will output a table showing all feature flags and their usage counts, helping identify which flags are candidates for removal.

## Removing Rolled Out Flags

Once you've identified a flag that's ready to be removed, Codegen can help safely delete it and its associated code paths.

<Tip>
    This primarily leverages Codegen's API for [reduction conditions](/building-with-codegen/reducing-conditions)
</Tip>

### Python Example

For Python codebases, here's how to remove a feature flag and its usages:

```python
flag_name = "FEATURE_TO_REMOVE"

# Get the feature flag variable
feature_flag_file = codebase.get_file("app/utils/feature_flags.py")
flag_class = feature_flag_file.get_class("FeatureFlag")

# Check if the flag exists
flag_var = flag_class.get_attribute(flag_name)
if not flag_var:
    print(f'No such flag: {flag_name}')
    return

# Remove all usages of the feature flag
for usage in flag_var.usages:
    if isinstance(usage.parent, IfBlockStatement):
        # For if statements, reduce the condition to True
        usage.parent.reduce_condition(True)
    elif isinstance(usage.parent, WithStatement):
        # For with statements, keep the code block
        usage.parent.code_block.unwrap()
    else:
        # For other cases, remove the usage
        usage.remove()

# Remove the flag definition
flag_var.remove()

# Commit changes
codebase.commit()
```

### React/TypeScript Example

For React applications using a hooks-based feature flag system:

```python
feature_flag_name = "NEW_UI_ENABLED"
target_value = True  # The value to reduce the flag to

print(f'Removing feature flag: {feature_flag_name}')

# 1. Remove from configuration
config_file = codebase.get_file("src/featureFlags/config.ts")
feature_flag_config = config_file.get_symbol("FEATURE_FLAG_CONFIG").value
if feature_flag_name in feature_flag_config.keys():
    feature_flag_config.pop(feature_flag_name)
    print('✅ Removed from feature flag config')

# 2. Find and reduce all hook usages
hook = codebase.get_function("useFeatureFlag")
for usage in hook.usages:
    fcall = usage.match
    if isinstance(fcall, FunctionCall):
        # Check if this usage is for our target flag
        first_arg = fcall.args[0].value
        if isinstance(first_arg, String) and first_arg.content == feature_flag_name:
            print(f'Reducing in: {fcall.parent_symbol.name}')
            # This automatically handles:
            # - Ternary expressions: flag ? <New /> : <Old />
            # - If statements: if (flag) { ... }
            # - Conditional rendering: {flag && <Component />}
            fcall.reduce_condition(target_value)

# 3. Commit changes
codebase.commit()
```

This will:
1. Remove the feature flag from the configuration
2. Find all usages of the `useFeatureFlag` hook for this flag
3. Automatically reduce any conditional logic using the flag
4. Handle common React patterns like ternaries and conditional rendering
