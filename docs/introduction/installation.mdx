Install and set up Codegen in your development environment.

#### We currently support:
- Running Codegen in Python 3.12 - 3.13 (recommended: Python 3.13+)
- macOS and Linux
  - macOS is supported
  - Linux is supported on x86_64 and aarch64 with glibc 2.34+
  - Windows is not supported
- Python, Typescript, Javascript and React codebases

## Prerequisites

We recommend using [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for installation. If you haven't installed `uv` yet:
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

## Installing Codegen

```bash
uv tool install codegen --python 3.13
```


<Note>
This makes the `codegen` command available globally in your terminal, while keeping its dependencies isolated.
</Note>

## Quick Start

Let's walk through a minimal example of using Codegen in a project:

1. Navigate to your repository:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/project
   ```

2. Initialize Codegen in your project with [codegen init](/cli/init):
   ```bash
   codegen init
   ```

   This creates a `.codegen/` directory with:
   ```bash
   .codegen/
   ├── .venv/            # Python virtual environment (gitignored)
   ├── config.toml       # Project configuration
   ├── codemods/         # Your codemod implementations
   ├── jupyter/          # Jupyter notebooks for exploration
   └── codegen-system-prompt.txt  # AI system prompt
   ```

3. Create your first codemod with [codegen create](/cli/create):
   ```bash
   codegen create organize-imports \
     -d "Sort and organize imports according to PEP8"
   ```
    <Note>
        The `-d` flag in `codegen create` generates an AI-powered implementation. This requires a Github account registered on [codegen.sh](https://codegen.sh)
    </Note>



4. Run your codemod with [codegen run](/cli/run):
   ```bash
   codegen run organize-imports
   ```

5. Reset any filesystem changes (excluding `.codegen/*`) with [codegen reset](/cli/reset):
   ```bash
   codegen reset
   ```

## Troubleshooting

Having issues? Here are some common problems and their solutions:

- **I'm hitting an UV error related to `[[ packages ]]`**: This means you're likely using an outdated version of UV. Try updating to the latest version with: `uv self update`.
- **I'm hitting an error about `No module named 'codegen.sdk.extensions.utils'`**: The compiled cython extensions are out of sync. Update them with `uv sync --reinstall-package codegen`.
- **I'm hitting a `RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded` error while parsing my codebase**: If you are using python 3.12, try upgrading to 3.13. If you are already on 3.13, try upping the recursion limit with `sys.setrecursionlimit(10000)`.
