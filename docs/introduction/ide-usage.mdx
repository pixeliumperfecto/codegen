Get up and running with Codegen programs in IDEs like VSCode, Cursor and PyCharm.

<Tip>Make sure to [install and initialize](/introduction/installation) Codegen with `codegen init`</Tip>

## Configuring your IDE Interpreter

Codegen creates a custom Python environment in `.codegen/.venv`. Configure your IDE to use this environment for the best development experience.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="VSCode, Cursor and Windsurf" icon="window-maximize">
    1. Open the Command Palette (Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P)
    2. Type "Python: Select Interpreter"
    <img src="/images/set-interpreter.png" />
    3. Choose "Enter interpreter path"
    4. Navigate to and select:
       ```bash
       .codegen/.venv/bin/python
       ```
    
    Alternatively, create a `.vscode/settings.json`:
        ```json
        {
          "python.defaultInterpreterPath": "${workspaceFolder}/.codegen/.venv/bin/python",
          "python.analysis.extraPaths": [
            "${workspaceFolder}/.codegen/.venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages"
          ]
        }
        ```

    5. Install the VSCode Python Extensions for LSP and debugging support. We recommend Python, Pylance and Python Debugger for the best experience.
      <img src="/images/python-extensions.png" />
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="PyCharm" icon="python">
    1. Open PyCharm Settings/Preferences
    2. Navigate to "Project > Python Interpreter"
    3. Click the gear icon ⚙️ and select "Add"
    4. Choose "Existing Environment"
    5. Set interpreter path to:
       ```bash
       .codegen/.venv/bin/python
       ```
    
    For better type hints:
    1. Right-click on `.codegen/.venv`
    2. Mark Directory as > Sources Root
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Troubleshooting" icon="wrench">
    Common issues and solutions:

    - **Missing Completions**: Make sure the interpreter is correctly set and the environment has `codegen` installed
    - **Import Errors**: Verify the environment is activated and Python path includes the virtual environment
    - **Wrong Python Version**: Check that you're using Python 3.11 or higher in `.codegen/.venv`
    
    Run this to verify your environment:
    ```bash
    .codegen/.venv/bin/python -c "import codegen; print(codegen.__version__)"
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>


## Create a New Codemod

Generate the boilerplate for a new code manipulation program using [codegen create](/cli/create):

```bash
codegen create organize-types \
  -d "Move all TypeScript types to \
      into a centralized types.ts file"
```

<Tip>
    Passing in `-d --description` will get an LLM expert to compose an initial version for you. This requires a Github account registered on [codegen.sh](https://codegen.sh)
</Tip>

This will:
1. Create a new codemod in `.codegen/codemods/organize_types/`
2. Generate a custom `system-prompt.txt` based on your task
3. Set up the basic structure for your program

<Note>
The generated codemod includes type hints and docstrings, making it easy to get IDE autocompletion and documentation.
</Note>

## Iterating with Chat Assistants

When you do `codegen init`, you will receive a [system prompt optimized for AI consumption](/introduction/work-with-ai) at `.codegen/codegen-system-prompt.txt`.

If you reference this file in "chat" sessions with Copilot, Cursor, Cody, etc., the assistant will become fluent in Codegen.

</Frame>

In addition, when you [create](/cli/create) a codemod with "-d", Codegen generates an optimized system prompt in `.codegen/codemods/{name}/{name}-system-prompt.txt`. This prompt contains:
- Relevant Codegen API documentation
- Examples of relevant transformations
- Context about your specific task

<Tip>
You can also drag and drop the system prompt ([available here](/introduction/work-with-ai))file directly into chat windows like ChatGPT or Claude for standalone help.
</Tip>

## Running and Testing Codemods

```bash
# Run => write changes to disk
codegen run organize-types

# Reset changes on disk
codegen reset
```

<Tip>You can also run the program directly via `.codegen/.venv/bin/python path/to/codemod.py` or via your editor's debugger</Tip>

## Viewing Changes

We recommend viewing changes in your IDE's native diff editor.
