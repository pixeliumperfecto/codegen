Codegen is built on an [open-source library](/introduction/overiew.mdx) for code manipulation.

It combines "tools" for code editing with powerful integrations, including Github, Linear and Slack.

## How Codegen Uses These Tools

Codegen's AI brain (powered by Claude 3.7 Sonnet) intelligently selects and combines these tools to:

1. Understand your requests through natural language in Slack
2. Determine the most appropriate tools to fulfill your request
3. Execute the necessary actions across GitHub, Linear, and your codebase
4. Provide clear, helpful responses back in Slack

This seamless integration allows you to manage your entire development workflow through simple conversations, without having to switch between different platforms and interfaces.
