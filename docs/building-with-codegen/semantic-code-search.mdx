Codegen provides semantic code search capabilities using embeddings. This allows you to search codebases using natural language queries and find semantically related code, even when the exact terms aren't present.

## Basic Usage

Here's how to create and use a semantic code search index:

```python
# Parse a codebase
codebase = Codebase.from_repo('fastapi/fastapi', language='python')

# Create index
index = FileIndex(codebase)
index.create() # computes per-file embeddings

# Save index to .pkl
index.save('index.pkl')

# Load index into memory
index.load('index.pkl')

# Update index after changes
codebase.files[0].edit('# 🌈 Replacing File Content 🌈')
codebase.commit()
index.update() # re-computes 1 embedding
```


## Searching Code

Once you have an index, you can perform semantic searches:

```python
# Search with natural language
results = index.similarity_search(
    "How does FastAPI handle dependency injection?",
    k=5  # number of results
)

# Print results
for file, score in results:
    print(f"\nScore: {score:.3f} | File: {file.filepath}")
    print(f"Preview: {file.content[:200]}...")
```
<Tip>The `FileIndex` returns tuples of ([File](/api-reference/core/SourceFile), `score`)</Tip>

<Note>
The search uses cosine similarity between embeddings to find the most semantically related files, regardless of exact keyword matches.
</Note>

## Available Indices

Codegen provides two types of semantic indices:

### FileIndex

The `FileIndex` operates at the file level:
- Indexes entire files, splitting large files into chunks
- Best for finding relevant files or modules
- Simpler and faster to create/update

```python
from codegen import FileIndex

index = FileIndex(codebase)
index.create()
```

### SymbolIndex (Experimental)

The `SymbolIndex` operates at the symbol level:
- Indexes individual functions, classes, and methods
- Better for finding specific code elements
- More granular search results

```python
from codegen import SymbolIndex

index = SymbolIndex(codebase)
index.create()
```

## How It Works

The semantic indices:
1. Process code at either file or symbol level
2. Split large content into chunks that fit within token limits
3. Use OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small model to create embeddings
4. Store embeddings efficiently for similarity search
5. Support incremental updates when code changes

When searching:
1. Your query is converted to an embedding
2. Cosine similarity is computed with all stored embeddings
3. The most similar items are returned with their scores

<Warning>
Creating embeddings requires an OpenAI API key with access to the embeddings endpoint.

## Example Searches

Here are some example semantic searches:

```python
# Find authentication-related code
results = index.similarity_search(
    "How is user authentication implemented?",
    k=3
)

# Find error handling patterns
results = index.similarity_search(
    "Show me examples of error handling and custom exceptions",
    k=3
)

# Find configuration management
results = index.similarity_search(
    "Where is the application configuration and settings handled?",
    k=3
)
```

The semantic search can understand concepts and return relevant results even when the exact terms aren't present in the code.
