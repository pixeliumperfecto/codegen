Two and a half years since the launch of the GPT-3 API, code assistants have emerged as potentially the premier use case of LLMs. The rapid adoption of AI-powered IDEs and prototype builders isn't surprising — code is structured, deterministic, and rich with patterns, making it an ideal domain for machine learning. Experienced developers working with tools like Cursor (myself included) can tell that the field of software engineering is about to go through rapid change.

Yet there's a striking gap between understanding and action. Today's AI agents can analyze enterprise codebases and propose sophisticated improvements—eliminating tech debt, untangling dependencies, improving modularity. But ask them to actually implement these changes across millions of lines of code, and they hit a wall. Their ceiling isn't intelligence—it's the ability to safely and reliably execute large-scale modifications on real, enterprise codebases.

The bottleneck isn't intelligence — it's tooling. By giving AI models the ability to write and execute code that modifies code, we're about to unlock an entire class of tasks that agents already understand but can't yet perform. Code execution environments represent the most expressive tool we could offer an agent—enabling composition, abstraction, and systematic manipulation of complex systems. When paired with ever-improving language models, this will unlock another step function improvement in AI capabilities.

## Beating Minecraft with Code Execution

In mid-2023, a research project called [Voyager](https://voyager.minedojo.org) made waves: it effectively solved Minecraft, performing several multiples better than the prior SOTA. This was a massive breakthrough as previous reinforcement learning systems had struggled for years with even basic Minecraft tasks.

While the AI community was focused on scaling intelligence, Voyager demonstrated something more fundamental: the right tools can unlock entirely new tiers of capability. The same GPT-4 model that struggled with Minecraft using standard agentic frameworks (like [ReAct](https://klu.ai/glossary/react-agent-model)) achieved remarkable results when allowed to write and execute code. This wasn't about raw intelligence—it was about giving the agent a more expressive way to act.

The breakthrough came from a simple yet powerful insight: let the AI write code. Instead of limiting the agent to primitive "tools," Voyager allowed GPT-4 to write and execute [JS programs](https://github.com/MineDojo/Voyager/tree/main/skill_library/trial2/skill/code) that controlled Minecraft actions through a clean API.

```javascript
// Example "action program" from Voyager, 2023
//   written by gpt-4
async function chopSpruceLogs(bot) {
  const spruceLogCount = bot.inventory.count(mcData.itemsByName.spruce_log.id);
  const logsToMine = 3 - spruceLogCount;
  if (logsToMine > 0) {
    bot.chat("Chopping down spruce logs...");
    await mineBlock(bot, "spruce_log", logsToMine);
    bot.chat("Chopped down 3 spruce logs.");
  } else {
    bot.chat("Already have 3 spruce logs in inventory.");
  }
}
```

This approach transformed the agent's capabilities. Rather than being constrained to atomic actions like `equipItem(...)`, it could create higher-level operations like [`craftShieldWithFurnace()`](https://github.com/MineDojo/Voyager/blob/main/skill_library/trial2/skill/code/craftShieldWithFurnace.js) through composing JS APIs. Furthermore, Wang et al. implemented a memory mechanism, in which successful "action programs" could later be recalled, copied, and built upon, effectively enabling the agent to accumulate experience.

As the Voyager authors noted: 

<Tip>*"We opt to use code as the action space instead of low-level motor commands because programs can naturally represent temporally extended and compositional actions, which are essential for many long-horizon tasks in Minecraft."*</Tip>

## Code is an Ideal Action Space

The implications of code as an action space extend far beyond gaming. This architectural insight — letting AI act through code rather than atomic commands — will lead to a step change in the capabilities of AI systems. Nowhere is this more apparent than in software engineering, where agents already understand complex transformations but lack the tools to execute them effectively.

When an agent writes code, it gains several critical advantages over traditional atomic tools:

- **Composability**: Agents can build their own tools by combining simpler operations. This aligns perfectly with LLMs' demonstrated ability to compose and interpolate between examples to create novel solutions.

- **Constrained Action Space**: Well-designed APIs act as guardrails, making invalid operations impossible to express. The type system becomes a powerful tool for preventing entire classes of errors before they happen.

- **Objective Feedback**: Code execution provides immediate, unambiguous feedback through stack traces and error messages—not just confidence scores. This concrete error signal is invaluable for learning.

- **Natural Collaboration**: Programs are a shared language between humans and agents. Code explicitly encodes reasoning in a reviewable format, making actions transparent, debuggable, and easily re-runnable.

## For Software Engineering

Software engineering tasks are inherently programmatic and graph-based — dependency analysis, refactors, control flow analysis, etc. Yet today's AI agents interface with code primarily through string manipulation, missing the rich structure that developers and their tools rely on. By giving agents APIs that operate on the codebase's underlying graph structure rather than raw text, we can unlock a new tier of capabilities. Imagine agents that can rapidly traverse dependency trees, analyze control flow, and perform complex refactors while maintaining perfect awareness of the codebase's structure.

Consider how a developer thinks about refactoring: it's rarely about direct text manipulation. Instead, we think in terms of high-level operations: "move this function," "rename this variable everywhere," "split this module." These operations can be encoded into a powerful Python API:

```python
# simple access to high-level code constructs
for component in codebase.jsx_components:
    # access detailed code structure and relations
    if len(component.usages) == 0:
        # powerful edit APIs that handle edge cases
        component.rename(component.name + 'Page')
```
